## About the Video Course
As a website owner, it’s hard to know what tactics are viable in growing your website’s online visibility. Everyone says that links are important in gaining traffic from Google, but no one talks about how to secure good links that make sense from relevant websites. That's why we put this course together. We’ve built links for every business imaginable, from Fortune 500 to small online mom and pop shops. After that, we will teach you how to find target sites for link prospecting, including analyzing a competitor’s backlinks, using advanced search in Google, and how to analyze a website and post a link to it.
